# EuPago Ruby SDK

This is a not official Ruby SDK for the EuPago payment gateway.

## Installation

WIP

## Testing

```bash
bundle exec rake
```

## Contributing

I am open to contributions! But with limited time, I cannot promise to respond to every issue or pull request. However, I will do my best to review and merge contributions that align with the project's goals.

I'm open to send this SDK to the official EuPago team if they are interested in maintaining it.
