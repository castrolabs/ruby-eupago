Then, in your Ruby code:

## Contributing

I am open to contributions! But with limited time, I cannot promise to respond to every issue or pull request. However, I will do my best to review and merge contributions that align with the project's goals.

If you have some questions about the structure of the project, i am following the [ruby-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/ruby-auth0) structure. They have a great SDK and a well defined structure.
